## Research

### Exploration
- Cheaper Batteries (10:00) - Reduce __Suit Battery__ OG cost by 50%.
  - [II] Cheaper Climbing (10:00) - Reduces the energy cost for medium and high climbs by 50%.    
- Hook Upgrades (4:00) - Allow to climb up high cliffs. (REQ - Hook???)
- [II][*] Suit Upgrade I (6:00) - Increases the capacity of the Suit Battery to 8 bars and radiation resistance to 20%.
  - [II] Luminator Density I (6:00) - Increases the density of the Luminator's light by 25%, allowing for quicker anomaly neutralization.
  - [II] Luminator Range I (6:00) - Increases the Luminator's maximum range by 25%.
  - [II] Anomaly Shield +1 (06:00) - An anomaly shield neutralizes the radiation from walking into an anomaly.
  - [II] Quick Crafting	(06:00) -	Unlocks the ability to quickly craft Drill Charges, Suit Batteries, and Shield Recharges outside the base. 
- [II] Hub Pylon (10:00) - Unlocks a hub pylon, which has a much greater range than a standard pylon.
- [II] Probes Upgrade I	(10:00) - The number of scanner probes rises to 8. The connection range between probes is longer.

### Economy
- Enriched Metals Efficiency I (6:00) - Mining and refining Enriched Metals is 15% faster.
- Non-Metals Efficiency I (6:00) - Mining Minerals, Rapidium, and Organics is 15% faster.
- Metal Efficiency I (6:00) -	Mining Metals is 15% faster.

### Base
- Magnetic Storm Analysis	(6:00) - Analyze Magnetic Storms and research a way to predict them. (REQ first magnetic storm)
- Park with Bench (10:00) -	Unlocks a Park with Bench where an Alter can relax in his free time. (REQ technitian request???)
- Recycler (10:00) - Module that produces Organics daily. The more people in base, the more Organics produced.
- Base Maintenance Workplace (10:00) - Unlocks a second workplace in the Base Maintenance module.

### Mission
