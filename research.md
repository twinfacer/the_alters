## Research

### Exploration
- Cheaper Batteries (10:00) - Reduce __Suit Battery__ OG cost by 50%.
  - [II] Cheaper Climbing (10:00) - Reduces the energy cost for medium and high climbs by 50%.
    - [IV][*] Free Climbing (6:00) - Reduces the energy cost for medium and high climbs to 0.  
- Hook Upgrades (4:00) - Allow to climb up high cliffs. (REQ - Hook???)
- [II][*] Suit Upgrade I (6:00) - Increases the capacity of the Suit Battery to 8 bars and radiation resistance to 20%.
  - [II] Luminator Density I (6:00) - Increases the density of the Luminator's light by 25%, allowing for quicker anomaly neutralization.
    - [III] Luminator Density II (6:00) - Increases the density of the Luminator's light by 100%, allowing for quicker anomaly neutralization.
  - [II] Luminator Range I (6:00) - Increases the Luminator's maximum range by 25%.
    - [III] Luminator Range II (6:00) - Increases the Luminator's maximum range by 30%.
  - [II] Anomaly Shield +1 (06:00) - An anomaly shield neutralizes the radiation from walking into an anomaly.
    - [III]	Anomaly Shield +1	(6:00) - This research adds 1 charge to the Anomaly Shield.
      - [IV] Increased ALX Recovery (6:00) - Increases the amount of ALX collected after neutralizing and anomaly by 40%. 
  - [II] Quick Crafting	(06:00) -	Unlocks the ability to quickly craft Drill Charges, Suit Batteries, and Shield Recharges outside the base. 
  - [III][**] Suit Upgrade II (6:00) - Increases the capacity of the Suit Battery to 10 bars and radiation resistance to 50%.
    - [IV] Anomaly Shield +1 (6:00) - This research adds 1 charge to the Anomaly Shield.
    - [IV] Energy Gate Inversion (6:00) - Unlocks the ability to reverse the polarity of an Energy Gate with the Luminator. After being illuminated, the Gate will completely refill your Suit Battery.
- [II] Hub Pylon (10:00) - Unlocks a hub pylon, which has a much greater range than a standard pylon.
- [II] Probes Upgrade I	(10:00) - The number of scanner probes rises to 8. The connection range between probes is longer.
  - [III] Probes Upgrade II	(10:00) -	The number of scanner probes rises to 10. The connection range between probes is even longer.
