### Run
=== Prologue (01-04) === 

== Day 01
- Run to Base, Contact Earth, (??? and turn on radiation filters _auto use_) then goto sleep.

== Day 02 (30 MT, 100 OG, 19 MU)
- Go outside - gather 2 __SMetal__ on the way to __DOrganics__.
- Return to base - build __Workshop__ and __Elevator__ to lowest lvl then move __QC__ there.  Craft __Scanner__. Goto towards __DOrganics__ but left.
- Gather __SRapidium__ on the way then goto and find __DOrganics__. Build __Miner Outpost__ there. Then connect __Miner Outpost__ via __Pylons__ through cliff.
- Goto and collect items at 2 sites at bottom of a map. Then goto base. If you have spare time - goto __DOrganics__ and mine them until days come to end.
- Answer phonecall from __Lucas__. Build __Womb__ at lowest lvl right to __QC__. Test Rapidium. Answer another phonecall from __Lucas__. Goto sleep.

== Day 03 (40+ MT , 100+ OG, 50 RaP, 18 MU)
- Goto another 2 __SMetal__ deport and grind them. Then returns to base entrance then TP to __DOrganics__ and grind them until night. Then TP to Base.
- Build a __Kitchen__ (up to __Airlock__), craft __Mush__ till you are near _exhausted_. Then goto sleep.

== Day 04 (160+ MT , ~200 OG, 50 RaP, ~20 MU)
- Continue craft __Mush__ til quest is done (23 __Mush__). After that go __DOrganics__ and grind them until 300 OG reached. Then try to start engine. Fix them then try another time. Call to earth, examine __QC__, then call earth again. Create __Technician__ alter.

=== Act I (6-???) ===

== Day 06 (150+ MT, ??? OG 30 RaP, ?? MU)
- Speak with __Mechanic__.

```
--- DISSCUS

```
- Build neccasary base modules - __Research Lab__.
- Queue neccesary stuff in __Workshop__ (__Grappling Hook__, __Miner Outpost__, __Pylon Package__  and __Ventra Drill__) and assign __Technitian__ to it.
- Go outside. Goto up left and collect 2 __SMetal__ deposit then return close to base.
- Goto bottom-left through __DEnriched__ (turn right in the middle to collect  __Class Photo__, __Rubber Duck__ and __Secret Alien Movie__) find __DMetal__. Build __Miner Outpost__. Connect it w Base using 3 __Pylons__ throug cliff. (??? assign __Technitian__ to work here, he must be done with __Workshop__ tasks by now)
- Build a __Pylon__ near cliff with __SOrganics__ near it. Drill it down then goto back to base entrance but run further do discover lava river. Turn right and find __SOrganics__ first (grind it down) then __DOrganics__ deposit after. Place __Miner Outpost__ on it and connect it to base via 1 __Pylon__ (move close to last build __Pylon__ to do it). Ran back to __Miner Outpost__ and TP back to base.
- Goto __QC__ and create __Scientist__ alter. Then goto sleep.

== Day 7
- ??? Queue __Miner Outpost__ (??? and __Pylon Package__ if need for pylons) at workshop. Assign ??? to it (If has spare metal and plan to build a __DRapidium__ outpost today)
- Goto __Womb__ and wake up __Scientist__.  

```
--- 

```

- Assign __Scientist__ to __Research Lab__ (??? mb organics outpost instead). Goto talk to __Technitian__. (DORM?)

```
---

```

- Go toward __DEnriched__ but instead turn right near it, jump up to cliff and run near __SOrganics__ until you can see you base. Then build __Pylon__ as far form base but close to __SOrganics__ (??? then drill it down) as you can. After __SOrganics__ turn left then right than mine __SRapidium__. Return and clear _rock blockade_ further. Go and when __DRapidium__ deposit starts to appear turn left run further then drill __SMetal__ deposit.
- ??? Return back and find __DRamidium__ deposit (??? and build __Miner Outpost__ on them)
- ??? Return back and connect __Travel Pylon__ to your network. TP to base. (??? or grind some resources before night if has time) (??? turn on _radiation filter_ now?)
- ??? Build __Greenhouse__
- (??? talk to __Scientist__ ) Goto sleep.

== Day 8
